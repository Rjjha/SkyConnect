# Flight Booking System

## Description
This is an Airline managemnet and flight booking system based on microservices architecture. It has 4 microservices:
1. [Flight Notification Service](https://github.com/Rjjha/Flight-Notification-Service)
2. [Flight Booking Service](https://github.com/Rjjha/Flight-Booking-Service)
3. [Flight Search Service](https://github.com/Rjjha/Flight-Search-Service)
4. [Flight API Geateway](https://github.com/Rjjha/Flights_API_Gateway)

## Non Functional Requirements
Non functional Requirements
1.  We can expect more flight searching than bookings
2.  The system needs to be reliable in terms of booking
3.  Expect that we will be having 100k total users.
4.  100k bookings might come up in quarter
5.  In one day you might be getting 100 bookings
6.  System should make sure that we don?t change the prices where the
    booking payment is going on.
7.  System should be able to auto scale itself atleast for 3x more traffic.
